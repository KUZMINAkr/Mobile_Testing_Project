📖 Project Overview

This project contains the full documentation package for testing a mobile game application.
The focus of the project is to demonstrate manual QA skills:

Mobile functional testing

UI/UX testing

Exploratory testing

Test design

Documenting defects

Writing structured QA documentation

All files are prepared in a clean, portfolio-ready format.

🎯 Scope of Testing
✔ Functional Testing

App launch

Character movement logic

Swipe responsiveness

Jump mechanics

Obstacle interaction

Game-over conditions

✔ UI/UX Testing

UI visibility on mobile screen

Readability and layout

Touch input accuracy

Smoothness of interactions

Accessibility and usability

✔ Exploratory Testing

Free exploration of game behavior

Edge-case discovery

Unexpected game freezes

Hitbox inconsistencies

Input delay detection

📂 Documentation Included

All documentation is stored in separate, professionally structured files:

File	Description
Test_Plan.md	Test scope, approach, goals, risks, exit criteria
Checklist.md	Quick mobile UI & gameplay verification
Test_Cases.md	Detailed test case descriptions
Bug_Reports.md	Full defect list with severity & priority
Summary.md	Final testing report
🧪 Test Artifacts
✔ Test Plan

Covers project scope, testing strategy, roles, risks, and entry/exit criteria.

✔ Checklist

A simplified set of checks for fast validation of key mobile features.

✔ Test Cases

Well-structured workflows covering movement, interaction, collision behavior, and UI elements.

✔ Bug Reports

Formal defect descriptions including:

steps to reproduce

expected vs actual result

severity

priority

✔ Summary

Final evaluation of app stability, main issues, severity distribution, and testing results.

📊 Summary of Findings
✔ What works

Game launches properly

Core UI elements display correctly

Swipe controls are recognized

Main loops function without crashes

❌ Issues found

As documented in Bug_Reports.md:

Delayed swipe response

Incorrect character movement behavior

Hitbox triggers too early

Freeze during continuous swipe/hold interaction

Lack of clear lane-based movement system

📝 Conclusion

The game is functional but requires significant improvements in:

gesture handling

movement logic

collision detection

responsiveness

Status: Not ready for production release.
